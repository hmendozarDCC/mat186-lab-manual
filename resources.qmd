## 🛠️ Essential R & Data Science Tools

### RStudio Cheat Sheets
R can be challenging to memorize. These official "Cheat Sheets" are the industry standard for quick reference. These links lead to the official Posit documentation:

* [**Data Visualization (ggplot2)**](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html)
* [**Data Transformation (dplyr)**](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html)
* [**Quarto Markdown Reference**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown.html)
* [**Browse All Posit Cheat Sheets**](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

### AI for Learning (Generative AI Policy)
In this course, we use AI as a **tutor, not a replacement**. 

* **Good use:** "Explain why this t-test code is giving me an error."
* **Bad use:** "Write the entire conclusion for Lab 12 for me."
* *Tip: Always double-check AI-generated code; it can sometimes suggest outdated packages!*
