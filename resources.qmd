## 🛠️ Essential R & Data Science Tools

### Quarto & Markdown Help
Since we use Quarto for all lab reports, these guides will help you format your text, equations, and tables using industry standards:

* [**Data Visualization (ggplot2)**](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-visualization.html) — Reference for creating plots.
* [**Data Transformation (dplyr)**](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/data-transformation.html) — Reference for cleaning and filtering data.
* [**Quarto Markdown Basics**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) — Official guide for bolding, lists, and headers.
* [**Formatting Equations (LaTeX)**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#equations) — How to write professional math symbols.
* [**Table Syntax**](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) — How to organize data into accessible tables.
* [**Browse All Posit Cheat Sheets**](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)

### AI for Learning (Generative AI Policy)
In this course, we use AI as a **tutor, not a replacement**. 

* **Good use:** "Explain why this t-test code is giving me an error."
* **Bad use:** "Write the entire conclusion for Lab 12 for me."
* *Tip: Always double-check AI-generated code; it can sometimes suggest outdated packages!*

## 📺 Video Tutorials (Accessible OER)
If you prefer visual learning, these tutorials cover the core concepts of our course. All videos include Closed Captioning (CC) and transcripts via the YouTube links.

### 1. The Data Science Workflow
Understand the "Tidyverse" approach to importing, cleaning, and visualizing data.
