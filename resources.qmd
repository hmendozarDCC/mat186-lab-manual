## 🛠️ Essential R & Data Science Tools

### RStudio Cheat Sheets
R can be challenging to memorize. These official "Cheat Sheets" are the industry standard for quick reference:
* [Data Visualization with ggplot2](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
* [Data Transformation with dplyr](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-transformation.pdf)
* [Quarto Markdown Reference](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown.html)

### AI for Learning (Generative AI Policy)
In this course, we use AI as a **tutor, not a replacement**. 
* **Good use:** "Explain why this t-test code is giving me an error."
* **Bad use:** "Write the entire conclusion for Lab 12 for me."
* *Tip: Always double-check AI-generated code; it can sometimes suggest outdated packages!*
