# Lab 2: RStudio Projects and Quarto Documents

## Learning Objectives
* Create an **RStudio Project** to organize your work.
* Understand the structure of a **Quarto (.qmd)** document.
* "Render" a document into a professional HTML report.

## Part 1: RStudio Projects
In Data Science, organization is everything. An RStudio Project keeps your code, data, and images in one "folder" so R always knows where to look.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Click **File > New Project...**
3. Select **New Directory** > **New Project**.
4. Name your directory `MAT186_Labs` and save it to your Desktop or Documents.

<div class="dcc-note">
**Why use Projects?** It sets the "Working Directory" automatically. You'll never have to type long file paths like `C:/Users/Documents/Data...` again!
</div>

## Part 2: Creating a Quarto Document

# Lab 2: Introduction to Quarto

Quarto allows you to combine text, code, and results into one professional document. Follow these steps to get started.

## Creating your Document

1.  In the top menu, click **File > New File > Quarto Document...**
2.  Title it **"Lab 2"** and put your name as the **Author**.
3.  Click **Create**. It will open a quarto document.

## The Three Parts of a Quarto Document

A Quarto document is made of three distinct components:

### 1. The YAML Header
Look at the very top of the file. You will see text between two sets of three dashes (`---`). This is the **YAML Header**; it contains the "metadata" or settings for your document.

```yaml
---
title: "Lab 2"
author: "Your Name"
format: html
editor: visual
---
```



### 2. Markdown (Narrative)
The plain white areas of the document are called **Markdown**. This is where you write your analysis, explain your results, and answer questions. It works like a simplified word processor.

* You can make text **bold** by using `**double asterisks**`.
* You can make text *italic* by using `*single asterisks*`.

### 3. Code Chunks
The gray boxes starting with ` ```{r} ` and ending with ` ``` ` are called **Code Chunks**. This is where you put your R code to run calculations or create graphs.

```{r}
#| label: example-chunk
# This is a code chunk. R code goes here!
1 + 1
```

## Tip for Students
To run the code inside a chunk, click the green **Play** button in the top-right corner of the gray box. The result will appear directly below the chunk!

## Part 3: Rendering (The "Magic" Button)
To turn your code into a report:

1. Click the **Render** button (blue arrow icon) at the top of the editor.
2. RStudio will save the file and pop up a beautiful HTML window.

## 📝 Lab Task 2: Your First Calculation

1. **Create a Document**: Create a new Quarto document and save it as `Lab2_yourname`.
2. **Clear the Template**: Find the word **Quarto** (usually around line 10). Delete everything *below* that line so you have a clean workspace.
3. **Insert a Chunk**: Create a new R code chunk and type `2 + 2` inside it.
4. **Render and Check**: Click the **Render** button. Verify that the number `4` appears in your final HTML report.
5. **Submit**: Take a screenshot of your rendered HTML page and upload it to the submission folder.
