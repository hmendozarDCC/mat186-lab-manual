## Learning Objectives
* Understand the Linear Regression equation: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$.
* Calculate and interpret the **Correlation Coefficient ($r$)**.
* Fit a Linear Model in R using the `lm()` function.
* Evaluate model fit using **R-squared ($R^2$)**.


## Data Acquisition: Birth Weight Dataset (lbw.csv)

To complete the regression exercises, you need the `lbw.csv` dataset. Choose **one** of the methods below to load the data into R.


## Option 1: Direct Link (Recommended)
This method pulls the data directly from the lab manual website.

```r
# Load data directly from the web
url <- "[https://hmendozardcc.github.io/mat186-lab-manual/data/2026_Fall/lbw.csv](https://hmendozardcc.github.io/mat186-lab-manual/data/2026_Fall/lbw.csv)"
data <- read.csv(url)
# View the first few rows to confirm it loaded
head(data)
```
## Option 2: Local File
Use this if the file is saved in your project folder.
```r
# Load data from your local data folder
data <- read.csv("data/lbw.csv")
head(data)
```

## Part 1: Correlation ($r$)
Before building a model, we need to know if a linear relationship even exists. The correlation coefficient ($r$) ranges from **-1** to **1**.
* **1**: Perfect positive relationship.
* **0**: No relationship at all.
* **-1**: Perfect negative relationship.

```r
library(tidyverse)

# Calculate correlation between Mother's Weight (lwt) and Birth Weight (bwt)
data |>
  drop_na(lwt, bwt) |>
  summarize(correlation = cor(lwt, bwt))
```
