Markdown (Narrative)\nThe plain white areas of the document are called Markdown. This is where you write your analysis, explain your results, and answer questions. It works like a simplified word processor.\n\nYou can make text bold by using **double asterisks**.\nYou can make text italic by using *single asterisks*.\n\n\n\n3. Code Chunks\nThe gray boxes starting with ```{r} and ending with ``` are called Code Chunks. This is where you put your R code to run calculations or create graphs.\n\n# This is a code chunk. R code goes here!\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTip for Students\n\n\n\nTo run the code inside a chunk, click the green Play button in the top-right corner of the gray box.

    "text": "To solve Lab 14, we focus on Bootstrapping, a powerful non-parametric method for estimating the uncertainty of a statistic (like the Median) without assuming the data is normally distributed. ::: {.callout-note} ### Instructor Note Add your specific DCC lab answers below this box. ::: ## Lab 14 Official Solutions: Resampling Methods\nIn this lab, we use the infer package to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the median enrollment in the SUNY system using bootstrapping.\n\n\nWe load the necessary libraries and clean our numeric variable by removing commas from the “Total Enrollment” column.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(infer) # Used for bootstrapping\n\n# Load the data\nny_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/race_ny.csv\")\n\n# Clean numeric variable\nclean_data &lt;- ny_data |&gt;\n  mutate(total_enroll = as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", `Total Enrollment`))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(total_enroll))\n\n\n\n\nBefore bootstrapping, we examine the original distribution of the data.\n\nggplot(clean_data, aes(x = total_enroll)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\", bins = 15) +\n  labs(title = \"Original Enrollment Distribution\",\n       x = \"Total Students\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Histogram of the original SUNY enrollment data.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The original data is strongly right-skewed. Because the distribution is not symmetrical, the Median is a better measure of the “typical” enrollment than the Mean.\n\n\n\nWe use the infer pipeline to generate 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the median.\n\n# 1. Specify the variable\n# 2. Generate 1,000 resamples with replacement\n# 3. Calculate the median for each resample\nset.seed(123)\nboot_dist &lt;- clean_data |&gt;\n  specify(response = total_enroll) |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"median\")\n\n# Visualize the bootstrap distribution\n#| label: fig-boot-dist\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of 1,000 bootstrap medians.\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A histogram showing the distribution of the calculated medians from 1,000 bootstrap samples.

Without replacement, every resample would simply be identical to the original dataset, and we would have no way to measure the uncertainty of our statistic.\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Back to Solutions Hub"

    "text": "To solve Lab 14, we focus on Bootstrapping, a powerful non-parametric method for estimating the uncertainty of a statistic (like the Median) without assuming the data is normally distributed. ::: {.callout-note} ### Instructor Note Add your specific DCC lab answers below this box. ::: ## Lab 14 Official Solutions: Resampling Methods\nIn this lab, we use the infer package to estimate the 95% confidence interval for the median enrollment in the SUNY system using bootstrapping.\n\n\nWe load the necessary libraries and clean our numeric variable by removing commas from the “Total Enrollment” column.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(infer) # Used for bootstrapping\n\n# Load the data\nny_data &lt;- read_csv(\"../data/race_ny.csv\")\n\n# Clean numeric variable\nclean_data &lt;- ny_data |&gt;\n  mutate(total_enroll = as.numeric(gsub(\",\", \"\", `Total Enrollment`))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(total_enroll))\n\n\n\n\nBefore bootstrapping, we examine the original distribution of the data.\n\nggplot(clean_data, aes(x = total_enroll)) +\n  geom_histogram(fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\", bins = 15) +\n  labs(title = \"Original Enrollment Distribution\",\n       x = \"Total Students\",\n       y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Histogram of the original SUNY enrollment data.\n\n\n\n\n\nObservation: The original data is strongly right-skewed. Because the distribution is not symmetrical, the Median is a better measure of the “typical” enrollment than the Mean.\n\n\n\nWe use the infer pipeline to generate 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the median.\n\n# 1. Specify the variable\n# 2. Generate 1,000 resamples with replacement\n# 3. Calculate the median for each resample\nset.seed(123)\nboot_dist &lt;- clean_data |&gt;\n  specify(response = total_enroll) |&gt;\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |&gt;\n  calculate(stat = \"median\")\n\n# Visualize the bootstrap distribution\n#| label: fig-boot-dist\n#| fig-cap: \"Distribution of 1,000 bootstrap medians.\"\n#| fig-alt: \"A histogram showing the distribution of the calculated medians from 1,000 bootstrap samples. The distribution is much more symmetrical and bell-shaped than the original data.\"\nvisualize(boot_dist) +\n  labs(title = \"Bootstrap Distribution of the Median\",\n       x = \"Bootstrap Median Enrollment\",\n       y = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe calculate the lower and upper bounds of our estimate using the percentile method.\n\n# Calculate the 95% Confidence Interval\npercentile_ci &lt;- boot_dist |&gt;\n  get_confidence_interval(level = 0.95, type = \"percentile\")\n\npercentile_ci\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower_ci upper_ci\n     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   88892.  101060.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we “sample with replacement” during bootstrapping?\nWe sample with replacement because we are treating our original sample as a “pseudo-population.” By allowing the same observation to be picked more than once (or not at all) in a single bootstrap resample, we simulate the natural variation that would occur if we were able to take many new independent samples from the actual entire population. Without replacement, every resample would simply be identical to the original dataset, and we would have no way to measure the uncertainty of our statistic.\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Back to Solutions Hub"

Interestingly, the boxplot reveals that total enrollment has been gradually declining across the semesters, evidenced by the median line shifting downward. A major outlier exists in the community college sector, representing a massive campus that significantly exceeds the average enrollment of all other schools.\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Back to Solutions Hub"

Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in mean enrollment between at least two of the SUNY sectors.\nFollow-up Analysis: According to the Tukey HSD test, almost all pairs show significant differences (p-adj &lt; 0.05). Specifically, the difference between Community Colleges and Technology Colleges is among the most extreme, while some other pairs might show overlapping intervals. This confirms that the size of an institution is heavily dependent on its specific sector classification.\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Back to Solutions Hub"

This means that for every 1 additional student enrolled at a SUNY institution, we expect the Hispanic/Latino student population to increase by about r round(coef(model)[2], 2) students on average.\nPredictive Power (\\(R^2\\)): The R-squared value of r round(summary(model)\\(r.squared, 4) suggests that roughly r round(summary(model)\\)r.squared * 100, 1)% of the variation in Hispanic student enrollment can be explained by the total size of the institution.\n\n\n\n\n\n🏠 Back to Solutions Hub"
