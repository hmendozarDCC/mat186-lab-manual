Markdown (Narrative)\nThe plain white areas of the document are called Markdown. This is where you write your analysis, explain your results, and answer questions. It works like a simplified word processor.\n\nYou can make text bold by using **double asterisks**.\nYou can make text italic by using *single asterisks*.\n\n\n\n3. Code Chunks\nThe gray boxes starting with ```{r} and ending with ``` are called Code Chunks. This is where you put your R code to run calculations or create graphs.\n\n# This is a code chunk.
