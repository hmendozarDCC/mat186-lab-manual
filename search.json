Non-parametric tests make no such assumption. They are often called “Distribution-Free” tests.\n\n\n\nYour sample size is very small (n &lt; 30).\nYour data is heavily skewed and cannot be fixed.\nYou have major outliers that you cannot remove.\nYour data is Ordinal (e.g., Likert scales: “Satisfied”, “Neutral”, “Dissatisfied”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the non-parametric alternative to the Independent Samples t-test (Lab 12). Instead of comparing means, it compares the medians by ranking all the data points from smallest to largest.\nScenario: Are the “Mass” values of Droids and Humans different? (Mass is often heavily skewed by outliers like Jabba the Hutt). ## Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test: Mass by Species\nThis test compares the distribution of mass between Humans and Droids. We use this non-parametric test because mass in the Star Wars universe is often skewed by very heavy characters (like Jabba the Hutt).\n\nAccessible Logic: The Wilcoxon test doesn’t compare means; it compares the ranks of the data. If one species tends to have higher ranks than the other, the test will return a significant result.\n\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(broom)\n\n# 1. Filter and clean the data\ncomparison_data &lt;- starwars |&gt; \n  filter(species %in% c(\"Human\", \"Droid\")) |&gt;\n  drop_na(mass)\n\n# 2.

Use this when you have “Before” and “After” measurements on the same subjects, but the differences are not normally distributed.\n# Example syntax for paired data\n# wilcox.test(before_scores, after_scores, paired = TRUE)\n\n# Creating mock 'before' and 'after' data for the example\nbefore &lt;- c(80, 75, 90, 85)\nafter  &lt;- c(82, 78, 88, 90)\n\ntidy_paired &lt;- broom::tidy(wilcox.test(before, after, paired = TRUE))\n\nknitr::kable(\n  tidy_paired[, c(\"statistic\", \"p.value\", \"method\")],\n  col.names = c(\"V Statistic\", \"p-value\", \"Test Method\"),\n  digits = 4\n)\n\n\n\nTable 2: Paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test results for character performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nV Statistic\np-value\nTest Method\n\n\n\n\n1.5\n0.2693\nWilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile non-parametric tests are safer for “messy” data, they are slightly less powerful than parametric tests when the data is actually normal. This means they are less likely to find a significant difference if one actually exists.\n\n\nLab Task 15:\n\nPick a numeric variable from your dataset that looks very skewed (not bell-shaped).\nCreate a Boxplot of this variable grouped by a category.\nRun a wilcox.test() to compare the two groups.\nRun a standard t.test() on the same data.\nCompare: In your Quarto document, compare the p-values. Are they similar? Which test do you trust more for this specific data, and why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are presenting data to a stakeholder and you are worried about one or two “crazy” outliers ruining your average, the Wilcoxon test is your best friend. It treats the outlier as just “the highest rank,” preventing it from pulling the results in its direction.",
