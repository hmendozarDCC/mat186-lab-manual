## ♿ Accessibility Checklist
*Professional data scientists make sure their work is readable by everyone!*

* [ ] **Human Labels:** Rename axis labels (like `lwt`) to real words (like "Mother's Weight").
* [ ] **Graph Titles:** Every visualization needs a clear, descriptive title.
* [ ] **Captions:** Use `#| fig-cap: "Description"` inside your R code chunks.
* [ ] **Clean Tables:** Use `knitr::kable()` to format your data nicely.

## 📤 Step-by-Step Submission

### 1. Rename Your Files
Before uploading, ensure your files follow this format:  
`Lab#_FirstName_LastName`  
*Example: **Lab2_Jane_Doe.qmd** and **Lab2_Jane_Doe.html***

### 2. Upload to GitHub (Your Portfolio)
* Go to your GitHub repository.
* Click **Add file** > **Upload files**.
* Drag **BOTH** the `.qmd` and the `.html` files into the box.
* **Important:** Scroll down and click the green **Commit changes** button.

### 3. Upload to Brightspace (For Grading)
* Go to the Lab folder in Brightspace.
* Upload **ONLY** the `.html` file. (This is the file I will grade).

## 🛑 If your code won't "Render"
If you have a code error you can't fix: 
1. Put a `#` at the start of the broken line (e.g., `# ggplot(...)`). 
2. This "comments out" the code so the rest of the document can finish. 
3. You might lose a technical point, but you can still earn points for the rest of your work!
