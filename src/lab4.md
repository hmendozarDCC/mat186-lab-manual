# Lab 4: Creating Your Data Science Portfolio on GitHub

## Learning Objectives
* Create a personal GitHub account.
* Initialize a new repository for MAT 186 work.
* Understand the "Commit" and "Push" workflow.
* Host a live version of a lab report using GitHub Pages.

## Introduction
Data Science is a collaborative field. GitHub is the industry standard for version control and sharing code. In this lab, you will set up your own "portfolio"—a place where you can showcase the work you do in this class to future employers or transfer institutions.

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Account
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com).
2. Sign up for a free account. 
   * **Tip:** Choose a professional username (e.g., `jsmith-dcc`), as you may show this to employers later!
3. Verify your email address.

## Part 2: Creating Your First Repository
A **Repository** (or "Repo") is like a project folder that lives in the cloud.

1. Click the **+** icon in the top right and select **New repository**.
2. **Repository name:** `mat186-work`
3. **Description:** "Labs and projects for Introduction to Data Science at DCC."
4. **Public/Private:** Select **Public**.
5. Check the box that says **Add a README file**.
6. Click **Create repository**.

## Part 3: Uploading Your Lab Reports
Now, let's add the work you've done in previous labs.

1. In your new `mat186-work` repository, click **Add file** > **Upload files**.
2. Drag and drop your **HTML files** from Lab 2 and Lab 3 into the browser.
3. At the bottom, type a "Commit message" like: `Initial upload of Lab 2 and 3`.
4. Click **Commit changes**.

---

## Part 4: Publishing with GitHub Pages
Let's make your lab reports viewable as actual websites.

1. Go to your repository **Settings** tab.
2. On the left menu, click **Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set the Branch to **main** and click **Save**.
4. After a minute, GitHub will give you a URL (e.g., `https://username.github.io/mat186-work/`).

<div class="dcc-important">
**Lab Task 4:** 1. Create your `mat186-work` repository.
2. Upload the HTML version of your Lab 3 (Math Formulas).
3. Enable GitHub Pages.
4. Paste the link to your live GitHub Page into the Brightspace assignment.

### **A Note on Open Science**
By putting your work on GitHub, you are participating in **Open Science**. This allows others to learn from your code and allows you to track your own progress throughout the semester!
