## Data collection - Official Solutions

::: {.callout-note}
### Instructor Note
Add your specific DCC lab answers below this box.
:::

### Tasks 1-4: Data Acquisition & Organization
The student's project folder must be organized correctly for the code to run. 

**Requirements:**
1. **Source:** [NY State Open Data Portal](https://data.ny.gov/).
2. **File Format:** CSV.
3. **Location:** The file `race_ny.csv` must be moved from "Downloads" into the `data/` folder inside the RStudio Project.



---

### Task 5: Data Narrative (The Paragraph)
*This is an example of what the student should have written in their Quarto document:*

> "This dataset, **race_ny.csv**, was obtained from the NY State Open Data Portal. The data was collected by New York State government agencies to track demographic participation. One row in this dataset represents a single recorded observation of an individual or event entry categorized by race and ethnicity for a specific year and location."

---

### Task 6: Importing and Displaying Data
The student must use `read_csv()` (from the `tidyverse` package) and `head(..., n = 10)`.

::: {.callout-important}
## Path Reminder
Since this solution is inside the `solutions/` folder, we use `../data/` to access the data folder. In the student's main lab file, they would likely just use `data/race_ny.csv`.
:::

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
# 1. Load the necessary library
library(tidyverse)

# 2. Load the data using the professional folder path
# Replace 'race_ny.csv' with the actual name of your downloaded file
ny_data <- read_csv("../data/race_ny.csv")

# 3. Show the first 10 rows
head(ny_data, n = 10)
```
