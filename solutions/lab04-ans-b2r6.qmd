### Instructor Note
Add your specific DCC lab answers below this box.
:::

### Task 1: Repository Configuration
The student should have successfully initialized a Git repository. 

**Verification Checklist:**

* [x] The repository is named `MAT186-Work`.
* [x] The visibility is set to **Public** (or Private if specified by the instructor).
* [x] A `.gitignore` file is present to exclude the `.Rproj.user` folder.



### Task 2: The Commit & Push Workflow
The "Solution" to this task is the successful appearance of the Quarto files on the student's GitHub URL. 

The command line sequence they should have used is:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Finished Lab 4 tasks"
git push origin main
```
