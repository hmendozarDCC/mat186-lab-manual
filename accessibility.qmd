## Commitment to Accessibility
This course site is designed to be accessible to all students, including those with disabilities. We aim to meet or exceed **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards, ensuring that every student at Dutchess Community College has equal access to our Data Science materials.

### Accessibility Features
To achieve our **100% Accessibility rating** (as verified by Lighthouse audits), we have implemented the following features:

* **Alt-Text for Data Visualizations:** Every chart, graph, and plot in our labs includes descriptive alternative text. This allows screen reader users to understand the trends and conclusions of the data without seeing the image.
* **Semantic Navigation:** We use a clear heading hierarchy (# H1, ## H2, ### H3) to allow for easy keyboard navigation and screen reader "heading jumps."
* **Mathematical Accessibility:** All mathematical notation is rendered using **MathJax**, which transforms LaTeX equations into readable text for assistive technologies.
* **Color Contrast:** Text and background colors have been selected to meet high contrast requirements for improved readability.
* **Accessible Code:** Code chunks are formatted to be legible and distinguishable from standard prose.

### Technical Specifications
Accessibility relies on the following technologies to work with the particular combination of web browser and any assistive technologies or plugins installed on your computer:
* HTML
* WAI-ARIA
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Feedback & Support
If you encounter any accessibility barriers while using this site, please contact me directly. I am committed to making adjustments to ensure you have the materials you need to succeed.

You may also reach out to the **DCC Office of Accommodative Services** for further support and official accommodations.
